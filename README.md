## Deployment

The recommended way of deploying µblog is via Docker. The docker file is included in the repository.

1. Deploy a PostgreSQL database and run the scripts in repository under `src/Infrastructure/Data/SQL`
2. `git clone https://github.com/mublog/mublog-server.git`
3. `cd mublog-server`
4. `docker build . -t mublog:latest`
5. `docker volume create mublog-data`
6. `docker volume create mublog-www`
7. compile the [front-end](https://github.com/mublog/mublog-web) and put the files into the docker volume `mublog-www`
8. `docker run --name mublog -d --restart=unless-stopped -v mublog-data:/data -v mublog-www:/app/wwwroot mublog`

It is recommended that you run an NGINX reverse proxy for higher security with HTTPS, [read about it here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx).
